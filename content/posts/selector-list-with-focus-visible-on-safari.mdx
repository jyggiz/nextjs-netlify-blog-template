Hello!

I recently ran into the problem of a non-working css selector on my project. This happened in safari browser (my version is Safari Version 13.1.3 (15609.4.1) - MacOS Catalina Version 10.15.7 (19H2))

Our `StartButton` component for some reason did not reproduce `:hover` styles in safari browser. HTML of my component looked like this:
```html
<a class="startButton" href="/intro/" style="">
	<span class="abs-fill" style="">
		<span class="abs-fill border"></span>
		<span class="abs-fill border"></span>
		<span class="abs-fill border"></span>
		<span class="abs-fill hover"></span>
	</span>
	<span class="label" style="">
		Choose your side
	</span>
</a>
```

The required CSS for this example looked like this:
```css
.startButton {
	// Some styles

	// It doesn't work
	&:hover, &:focus-visible {
    .hover {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: opacity 300ms $easeOutExpo, transform 300ms $easeOutExpo;
    }
  }
}
```

After a long debag process, I realized that safari version less than 15.4 on desktop does not support the selector `:focus-visible`.
[Support according to caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/?search=focus-visible).

After that, it was still unclear to me exactly why `:hover` did not acquire its own styles despite the fact that safari does not support `:focus-visible`. And then I started searching and found the information I needed in [one stackoverflow response](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38856208/what-happens-when-the-browser-doesnt-support-a-css-pseudo-class):

> If browser doesn't recognize the selector, it follows CSS2.1 §4.1.7 to the letter and drops the entire ruleset, no questions asked.

And now the words from the sources of the rule itself:

> When a user agent cannot parse the selector (i.e., it is not valid CSS 2.1), it must ignore the selector and the following declaration block (if any) as well.

The conclusion is that due to the fact that safari cannot recognize the `:focus-visible` pseudo-selector, the entire block with css declarations is simply ignored!

Now to fix this and restore `:hover` styles for `StartButton` we need to rewrite our CSS as follows:
```css
.startButton {
	// Some styles

	// It works
	&:hover {
    .hover {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: opacity 300ms $easeOutExpo, transform 300ms $easeOutExpo;
    }
  }

	&:focus-visible {
    .hover {
      opacity: 1;
      transform: scale(1);
      transition: opacity 300ms $easeOutExpo, transform 300ms $easeOutExpo;
    }
  }
}
```

Now we know how to avoid non-working styles in the selector list, which contains the selector `:focus-visible` in safari browser!

Thanks to everyone, cheers!
